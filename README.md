# blender-osgjs-loader
A fixed version of OSGJS Blender loader by mark2580 (cgig.ru), which allows for OpenSceneGraph models to be loaded into Blender.

# How to use?
1. Install Python 2.7 and Blender 2.49. Set the PythonPath environment variable to the install location of Python 2.7. (on Windows, this is C:\Python27 by default)
Your PythonPath should look like this: "C:\Python27; C:\Python27\DLLs; C:\Python27\Lib; C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk"

2. Open file Blender249.blend in Blender 2.49. Right-click on the Python script and click "Execute Script". In the file chooser, go to the folder where the .osgjs.gz file is located and click "import".

3. Wait and you're done!
